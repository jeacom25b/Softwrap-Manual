# Installation

This addon should come in a zip file form, the name of this file may vary depending of which version it is. and Installing addons in blender is quite simple you just need to follow these steps:


## Steps

1. Open blender.
2. In the `edit` menu, Go to `Preferences`

## Compatibility

Softwrap is currently fully compatible with Windows and Linux. a macos build is also available but its untested and not guaranteed to work properly so please don't rely on it.  
You probably deserve a explanation of why macos is not fully supported... Its because macs unfortunatelly too expensive and I cant afford one so I can only make builds remotely but not test the addon on a real mac.
