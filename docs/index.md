# Welcome to the Softwrap Manual

Welcome to this unfinished page, this manual is currently under construction.

Softwrap is an addon that helps with re-utilizing mesh topology inside blender. As the name states SoftWrap uses softbody simulation to wrap a mesh on another.

!!! disclaimer
    There's no such thing as automatic retopology, specially for characters and animated models.

    Softwrap can save you time on many ocasions, specially if you have many similar models that need to be retopologized.
    but you will probably encounter at some point a case where you *need* to retopo manually.

    So please don't take softwrap as a excuse to not learn how retopo if you do organic and animated models.

with that said Softwrap can save you time from having to retopo your models from scratch every time when you already did the process on some similar model previously or have a basemesh with similar shape
